class Gamepad:
    """
    Implements the NES gamepad.

    The NES gamepad is super easy to emulate. When writing 1 to the register,
    it starts reading the controller input. When 0 is set, the state is
    copied to the register and the register can be read one bit at a time.
    As the register is read, the bits are shifted inside the register.
    The state can be read one bit at a time, 8 times. The button states will be
    read in that order:
    - A
    - B
    - Select
    - Start
    - Up
    - Down
    - Left
    - Right.
