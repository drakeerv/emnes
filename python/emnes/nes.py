    Emulator for the NES.

    Instantiating this class will provide an emulated Nintendo. To use it,
    you must first provide a path to a rom via the load_rom method. After that,
    you can call the emulate method to emulate the console.

    You can reset the emulator by calling reset.

    A gamepad is connected to port 1 and the zapper to port 2. This is
    not configurable at the moment.
