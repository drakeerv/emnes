# PyNes (how unoriginal!)

## Introduction

Why another NES emulator? There are so many after all? Why not help a team working on an existing one? Well, I have a couple of reasons why I want to write one myself from scratch.

- Most emulators are written in C++. I've already written a Gameboy Emulator in C++ and I want to try my hand at writing optimized Python code.
- I want to practice engineering empathy. I want to write this project and document it so that any newcomer could just jump in and understand. So I'm going to try to document this every step of the way. What worked, what didn't. I'm planning to actually get people involved in this. I just want to get better at my craft.
- But most importantly, I'm doing this for fun.

## Other stuff

Except this README to grow over time. Right now I'm in the exploratory phase. Head over
to the [wiki](https://github.com/jfboismenu/pynes/wiki) to learn more about my process.
