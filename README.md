## Introduction

Why another NES emulator? There are so many after all? Why not help a team working on an existing one? Well, I have a couple of reasons why I want to write one myself from scratch.

- Most emulators are written in C++. I've already written a Gameboy Emulator in C++ and I want to try my hand at writing optimized Python code.
- I believe documentation is one of the most important skill for a developer and I want to get better at it. So I want to craft a documentation that is easy to read and publish.
- But most importantly, I'm doing this for fun.

# Running the emulator

You can't run the emulator yet, there's nothing for now.
